* Replace hard-coded filepath in create_textures.py with an environment variable (e.g. JITTR_DIR).
* Get texturing script to select the merged.png texture, and:
** Pack it into the blend file
** Export a corrected.obj file and copy the merged.png file alongside it
** Edit corrected.mtl so that the texture file path points to the merged.png
* Modify the "rendering script" (the .blend file for rendering datasets) so that it's easier to add new objects to it.
** Change setup so that it repeats the same camera/object animation for each object
** Modify python script (png->memmap) to match the # of lighting/elevaitons/azimuths.
