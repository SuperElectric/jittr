* Get texturing script to select the merged.png texture, and:
** Pack it into the blend file
** Export a corrected.obj file and copy the merged.png file alongside it
** Edit corrected.mtl so that the texture file path points to the merged.png
* Modify the "rendering script" (the .blend file for rendering datasets) so that it's easier to add new objects to it.
